  ## Description
  One of the most common features one will find on a webpage is a logo. It communicates what the webpage is about and what services they render. It is often an abbreviation of the company's name. One of the ways to make life easy for oneself is to write a code that can help web developers easily generate a logo by just answering and choosing shapes and colors and other features of interest. This project seeks to answer that by using preset colours and shapes. The shapes used are square, circle and triangle.
